# Main description
This is a repository so i can enhance my progamming, english and git/github skills. Here you can find scripts that can help in automation regarding files and organization, CLI tools and related kind of utilities.

## Advise
PLEASE BE CAREFUL: some of these were made when i was still on the early development of my scripting skills, DON'T USE ANY OF THE PYTHON SCRIPTS BEFORE M3 UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND KNOW THE RISKS (the risks include overwriting files and losing them for example).
